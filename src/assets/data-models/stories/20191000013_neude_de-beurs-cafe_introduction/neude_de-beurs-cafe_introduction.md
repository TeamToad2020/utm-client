# De Beurs Utrecht, Neude 37-39

_By Anna Tchitcherine_

De Beurs is but one of the noisy café restaurants located at the Neude. However, this café and the three buildings that belong to it, are packed with stories that have now been brought together under one roof.

### 'T Glindt, Neude 39

The building on the far left (NEUDE 39) bears an old-looking plaque with the inscription: _'t Glindt anno 1747_ (Fig. 1). Simply speaking, ''t Glindt' translates to 'the fence'. However, it could also refer to 'garden' or 'courtyard' (Campen, 1956, p. 79). Whatever it may mean, it seems that the owner wanted to create some peace and quiet for themselves in the middle of the rowdy and dirty seventeenth-century Neude.

### 17th-century Businesswomen

A previous owner of 't Glindt, certainly caused some upheaval, however. Maria van Lommen (1688 -- 1742) was the daughter of the silversmith Cornelis van Lommen (1656 -- 1715) and Cornelia Ondermerck (1667 -- 1724). At only 24 years old, she got her father's gold- and silver shop that was located in 't Glindt. In charge of buying the best pieces for her store, her mother and Maria herself became known as shrewd businesswomen. They were so cunning that even a letter of complaint was sent to the city council!

## De Zwarte Leeuw, Neude 38

### The black lion's adventure

The tallest building in the line-up, the one in the middle, also bears a plaque. On the plaque, you'll find a black lion with the inscription _De Zwarte Leeuw_ (The Black Lion) (Fig. 2). This plaque went on quite the adventure. It got lost in 1904, when the building was refurbished to become a warehouse for the sailcloth and sailcover firm Lammerts van Bueren, located in Neude 39. The plaque was only retrieved over a century later from a chimney at fort Blauwkapel in the north of the city (Moesman, 1903).

## Neude 37

### Ring ring!

Neude 37 marks the very beginnings of the telecommunication! In this building, four sturdy wooden pillars were found. These made up the substructure of an 1883 telephone installation by the Nederlansche Bell Telephoon Maatschappij (Dutch Bell Telephoon Company) (Holst, 1996, p. 138). Below, you can see what the 'telephone tower' used to look like before it was taken down (Fig. 3).
