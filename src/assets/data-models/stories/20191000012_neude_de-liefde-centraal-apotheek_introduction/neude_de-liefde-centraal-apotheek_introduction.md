# De Liefde's Centraal Apotheek, Voorstraat 6Â 

---

_By Anna Tchitcherine_

De Liefde's Central Pharmacy used to be one of the most central buildings of Neude's past. Today, it is a clothing store that is packed with history.

### Johan de Liefde

The pharmacy's name originates from a publisher for 'Het Utrechtsch Nieuwschblad' (The Utrecht Newspaper), Johan de Liefde. To promote this newspaper, he announced the Utrechtsch Nieuwschblad Ziekenfonds (Utrecht Newspaper Health Insurance Fund) which included De Liefde's Centraal Apotheek. The fund was meant for underprivileged citizens of Utrecht, but also offered free medical help to its staff and the ones subscribed to the newspaper. Eventually, the pharmacy became independent. However, its name would always remain tied to Johan de Liefde (De Jongh, 1993, p. 3-4).

### Peculiar Looks

The pharmacy can easily be distinguished from all the other buildings around it. This is due to its specific building style, called Jugendstil or Art Nouveau. The main inspiration for this style is nature; and especially the organic, long and sinuous lines found in it. De Liefde's Centraal Apotheek is a good representation of the Dutch variant of this style, which is based on simple geometric forms and decorations (Van Hulten et al, 1992, p. 33-34) (Fig. 2).
