It is **1624** when the name “t’Glindt” appears in the municipal register of Utrecht. It concerns the building on the corner and is the oldest building of the Beurs. If you look at the top of the building you are able to see a beautiful facing brick.

It is **1880** and next to “t Glindt” they are building “de zwarte leeuw”; it is the tallest building of the Beurs. If you take some distance from the building, you can see that the building is being used as a warehouse.

From **1996** there has been a popular café called the Beurs located in 4 historical buildings at the Neude.

In **2017** the Beurs is being rebuilt and with the help of architect Antione Pruyn all the old styles are being preserved.

Question:

- Try to focus on the buildings, what do you notice about them?
