After 5 painful years the post office is finally done in **1924**. Look at it, what an imposing building. The architect is Joseph Crouwel jr. He designed the building in the style of the 'Amsterdamse school'. "Amsterdamse school" is characterized by the use of expressive and fantastic forms, mostly related to expressionism in the imposing parabolic hall, there are six statues of people, which represent five continents. The sixth one you might wonder, represents trade and wealth.
