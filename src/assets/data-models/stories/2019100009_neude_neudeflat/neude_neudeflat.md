# Neudeflat

It is **1960** and next year the Neude flat will be built. It is 62 meters high and it has an office function. The municipality of Utrecht will be housed in it. They have built the building in a post-war style, a period of ‘reconstruction.’

It is **2014** and they are starting to convert the Neude flat into apartments. In the magazine Astrid de Wilde ‘de architect’ has stated that it could be possible that people might appreciate the flat in the future. But right now, this is what people think about it:\
_‘you really can see the beautiful buildings in front and then that… it is the worst building ever_
(Jorn, man, 24)’\
_‘The Neudeflat is really ugly, but fortunately you can’t see it while seated on the terrace.’_
(Ellen, 22, Neude)\
