## Health Committee Pleading for Better Sanitation! And Less Stink!

Following the industrialization, that took off in the Netherlands in the second half of the 19th century, people didn't work anymore at home and were more mobile than ever! Not only men, but also women flooded into P. Smits' sulphuric acid factory or Ludwig Monds alkali factory to work for 10 to 14 hours a day for a low wage. <sup><utm-source sourceUrl="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-3253-6_10">\[source\]</utm-source></sup> At the same time, discoveries in bacteriology, changed attitudes towards diseases. Diseases like Typhus and Diphteritis weren't considered anymore as a punishment for a person's sins, they were increasingly seen as consequence of bad housing and working conditions, in which germs could thrive. This brought about health movements that aimed at improving hygiene standards in the cities. The 'Utrechtsche gezondheidscommissie' was one of them. It was founded on the 8th of February in 1855. In their first year of existence, they already made an account on constructing urinals that were more efficient:

The founding of the Utrecht Health Committee was an outcome of a national health movement that advocated for health legislations and promoted of the Thorbecke health laws (1865). They were inspired by similar movements in Germany, Britain and France and found support in doctrinal liberalism. Thanks to these 'hygienists' the idea of a 'Public Health' was born. Nevertheless, their pleads were only remotely successful. According to historian E. S. Houwaart, the movement gathered momentum at the turn of the century, when a new generation came into existence, in which bacteriologists entered into an alliance with the radical liberals. <sup><utm-source sourceUrl="https://www.ntvg.nl/artikelen/de-hygi%C3%ABnisten-artsen-staat-en-volksgezondheid-nederland-1840-1890">\[source\]</utm-source></sup> This is the time, in which the "Gemeentewerken" of Utrecht designed a public restroom, that once stood on the Neude.

## The Solution to the Problem

As part of the Utrecht municipality, the "Gemeentewerken" constructed small, public buildings such as public bathrooms, lampposts, fountains, parks etc.

In May 1898, Dutch architect Ferdinand Jacob Nieuwenhuis sat in his office in the Achter Clarenburg 12-14, and looked down on a blueprint titled 'Retirade Gebouw'. F. J. Nieuwenhuis was from 1890 till 1915 director of the municipal utilities. As director he was responsible for the construction of cementaries, school buildings and slaughter houses. Literature about F. J. Nieuwenhuis is focused on his accomplishment as director and architect and his quarrels with Dutch famous architect Pierre Cuypers <sup><utm-source sourceUrl="https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/collectie/0B2D04FBBC9955F1955E77B85B682938">\[source\]</utm-source></sup> . Unfortunately, when it comes to his activities in the "Gemeentewerken" of Utrecht, the literature remains silent.

## The Problems to the Solution

Public restrooms represented in a way loopholes in a society and city that doesn't provide its citizens privacy. Considering the problem of the density in the houses and outside on the streets, there was no much space for retreat. Even in a public restroom, there was still a room reserved for the guard. But even the guard wasn't always capable of ensuring that the visitors of the restroom behaved accordingly to society's moral rules. The old 'retirade' was replaced by another public restroom that belonged to the post office. In a newspaper article from 1938 the author reports about "sex crimes" committed in there:

_"About a month and a half ago the police received a complaint that public retaliation of honor was regularly committed in the retirade under the post office at the Neude. The guardian of this retirade had often taken action against this, but this did not help adequately."_ <sup><utm-source sourceUrl="https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/collectie/CDFCBD46EFBB42BFB3080C9811CD161A">\[source\]</utm-source></sup>

How does the saying go? "What has been seen, cannot be un-seen." That would make a great title for the biography of one of these guards, don't you think?
