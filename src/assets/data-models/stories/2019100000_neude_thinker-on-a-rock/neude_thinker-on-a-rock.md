It is the year **1997**, the <utm-source sourceUrl="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinker_on_a_Rock">statue</utm-source> you are looking at right now has been bought by the municipality of Utrecht. The inhabitants and the city council aren’t very happy with the new purchase. They want the inhabitants to participate in deciding which statue to place at the Neude. Two other works of art will be selected, they will compete against the “Thinker on a rock” in an official referendum. The “Thinker on a rock” will temporary be placed in the Centraal Museum.

It is **2002**. The statue has won a competition with 83% of the votes, after which it was placed on the Neude at the opposite site of the Potterstraat where it still stands today.

**Today**, the statue is now part of the Neude. The people even use it to park their bikes against. And when FC Utrecht wins, the supporters will sometimes put a scarf around the neck of the bunny.

**Today**, there are a few different places where they have a “Thinker on a rock”, at the Washington University in St. Louis, the National Gallery of Art of Sculpture Garden and the John and Mary Pappajohn Sculpture Park in Des Moines.

**Questions**

- Do you think it is disrespectful to park your bicycle against the statue?

- Is the name “Thinker on a rock” fitting to the statue?
