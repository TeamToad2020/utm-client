# Taste: Drogisterij Woortman

### Drogisterij Woortman, Neude 3

_By Anna Tchitcherine_

Peek inside the window of Drogisterij Woortman to see what the mid-nineteenth century looked like. Different from the buildings we have explored so far, Drogisterij Woortman (Drugstore Woortman) has not changed much since its establishment in 1851. For a quick comparison, check out the photo of the pharmacy's interior below (Fig. 1).

Some of their old products have also made it into our era and are still available at the store! Examples include old-fashioned starch for your laundry, three different types of homemade waxes (polishing, marble and furniture), a selection of painter pigments and vegetable colorants. You can even get a taste of some pure Dutch salmiak powder. Of course, they also sell medicines us 'moderns' are familiar with; such as ibuprofen.

**The importance of Woortman**\
The man to have established the drug store in 1851 was Johan Woortman. The store seemed to have been successful, as 'Woortman' had become a household name when he moved to Amsterdam after his wife's death in 1889. It was so successful that the next store owner, Koenraad Plantinga, would not even change the name of the store. Johan eventually went back to living above his old store in 1911. Almost a decade later, in 1924, the man passed away at the age of eighty.

A lot later in the seventies, Hans Rijkman often came by the drugstore. Why? As the representative of the pharmaceutical industry he had to visit pharmacies to promote products. During these promotions, Hans often got to talk with Koenraad's son-in-law Roel Nijhuis. Eventually, spending a lot of time in the drugstore gave him the golden opportunity to take over the store. In a sense, he was just at the right place at the right time -- Koenraad was already getting too old _and_ Roel's and his wife Ietje Nijhuis-Plantinga's kids showed no interest in furthering their granddad's business. And so Hans got Drogisterij Woortman, on condition he maintained the 'character' of the place and that he would keep the name Woortman in the title.

While Ietje's kids were uninterested in the drugstore, Ietje herself had been helping her father out in the store ever since she turned seven. And so, when Hans took over the store, Ietje came with it. Hans reportedly said she was a 'walking encyclopedia' and that she made sure the store's authentic flair was maintained throughout the years. In total, she had worked at the store for sixty-eight years, quitting only in 1992 (Jansen, 2015).

**The current state of business**\
Today, Woortman Drogisterij is managed by Hans and assistant Frederike de Boer (Fig. 1). It still has regular clients who tend to flock to the more old-fashioned products. Some products are even more special since they are made in the warehouse behind the retail space (Fig. 2). There, you will find pots labelled in Latin, nutritional supplements and painkillers categorized by complaint, complete with handwritten instructions (Janssen, 2015). However, some regulars don't _just_ buy their products. There is a select clientele that just walk in to have a cup of tea or coffee with Hans and Frederike (DUIC, 2015). So it is as much of a business that safeguards their traditions as it is a place where you can be '_gezellig'_ (you will hear that word a lot in the Netherlands).

**The golden age of self-medication**\
The drug store often appeared in Het Utrechtsch Nieuwschblad of the twentieth century. In it, Woortman's Drogisterij advertised all the ointments, pills and syrups that were available at their store (Fig. 3). This heavy advertising can be tied to what is called the "golden age of self-medication" occurring in the 1900s. How did that come to be? Well, since products gained exclusive rights to use their brand --- and the free market and the customer's free choice remained untouched --- a huge amount of products could flood the Dutch market. Simultaneously, the newspaper stamp was abolished which allowed Het Utrechtsch Nieuwschblad to advertise products to more people than ever before (Huisman, 2002, p. 213-216) (Appendix).

### Translation:

**Important for parents: Children developing teeth.**

When the child first develops teeth, the salivary glands --- as all the other parts of the mouth --- will display unusual activity; the child drools and puts everything they get their hands on in their mouth, as if indicating where they feel the pain! For the ones with a tender and weak physique, where the development of the teeth occurs under difficult circumstances, fever, infections on the head and on the gums, swelling and infections on the ear salivary glands, cramps and often disturbances to the lower and digestive organs often occur. This can frequently endanger their life. Different medications are recommended and used to make this period easier. However, none of those alleviating and pain-relieving prescriptions has ever been as excellent in its effectiveness as the _ELECTROMOTORIC TOOTHCOLLARS or TOOTHBRACELETS_ manufactured by _Robert Holtz._ These have obtained big fame and as it seems from the testimonials, that are accessible for all, the product is proven excellent in use.Pay attention **especially** to the name of the manufacturer. Every box contains the original autograph **in red ink.** **ROBERT HOLTZ, Nijmegen.**These collars/bracelets can only be received through the money order of 95 cents, or the equal amount in stamps.Available in Utrecht at T.P. VAN DEN BERGH, Heilige weg 83, LOBRY & PORTON, Oude Gracht 22, J.C. WOORTMAN, Neude 3, HERMAN MISSET, Vredenburg 35.

**Advertisements as a mirror to society**\
Of course, the goal of advertisements is to sell products. In order to do that, the ones who write them need to create a meaning that is associated with the product. As this 'meaning' must appeal to people, advertisements would subtly refer to the societal and cultural norms which surrounded sickness, healing and health (Huisman, 2002, p. 212-213). This is, of course, still the case.

A concrete example from the 1900s are Dr. Williams' 1886 Pink Pills for Pale People. Originally from Canada, they quickly took the world by storm. The advertisements spoke of a miracle cure that could treat almost every disease such as eczema, paralysis and rickets (Tsay, 2019). These Pink Pills advertisements targeted women, and so shows us early twentieth century norms surrounding women. In the newspaper clipping seen below, the assumption that women should care about "maintaining their beauty" at all costs is clearly present.

### Translation:

**Beware, beautiful women!**\
Beware of the charming but dangerous spring. You are weak, all your organs are weak. Your blood is filled with impurities, and your weak kidneys cannot expel those impurities. They need to be removed from the body. They come out through the skin. Your sweet face will lessen in beauty and will become ugly through rash, red spots, pimples and ulcers. Your intestines are weak, the consequence is blockage that will give you a terrible headache, and that yellow or earthly color that makes you ugly. Your digestion is difficult and painful; after your meals you have an irresistible urge to sleep; your digestion is incomplete and its poisoned remains will in addition poison your already impure blood. Do not purge yourself, the purgation weakens you and you are already weakened.Use a resilient product.The Pink Pills are the most powerful resilient product. They give blood, and you have too little blood. They purify the blood, and the little blood that you have, is impure. They add resilience to your nerves, and your nerves that you have strained through regales, meetings, parties and work, have a great need for new resilience.The Pink Pills will awaken all your organs, which will again do the work that they are supposed to, and the balance will finally be restored. You will be clean again. If you do not take care of yourself now, you will pay for your negligence. Instead of enjoying the beautiful season, you will stay home to suffer, to take care of yourself and be bored.

**Take the Pink Pills**

The Pink Pills are available for f 1.75 per box and six boxes for f 9. They are available at het Generaal-DÃ©pot der Pink Pillen, van Eeghenlaan 22 huis, in Amsterdam.

**Appendix**

_How did the golden age of self-medication come about?_

- Firstly, with the medical laws of 1865 the government wanted to "academicize" pharmacy. The government would provide the opportunity to follow an academic program in pharmacy and monitor the professional behavior of academic medical practitioners. At the same time, the exams for drugstore workers were abolished. However, the principle of the free market and the customer's freedom of choice remained untouched.
- The abolition of the newspaper stamp in 1869 made the newspapers much cheaper - and buying them, or even having a subscription became a real possibility for more people. This expanded the scale and the transparency of the market. Additionally, the newspapers welcomed any advertisements since they were partially financially dependent on them.
- Due to the trademark law of 1880 which gave brands exclusive rights to use their brand. Already in the first year countless registrations for products like mineral waters, kina wine, elixirs, medicinal syrups, capsules were recorded.

And so; a big amount of new products flooded the Dutch market, which the newspapers would all but happily advertise to a broader market, and which the drugstore could sell through the principle of the free market (Huisman, 2002, p. 213-216).
