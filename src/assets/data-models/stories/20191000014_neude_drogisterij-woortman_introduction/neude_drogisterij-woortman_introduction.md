# Drogisterij Woortman, Neude 3

_By Anna Tchitcherine_

Peek inside the window of Drogisterij Woortman (Drug Store Woortman) to see what the mid-nineteenth century looked like, because this drug store has not changed much since its establishment in 1851. For a quick comparison, check out the photo of the pharmacy&#39;s interior below (Fig. 1).

Next to its historical interior, Drogisterij Woortman still sells old-fashioned products such as starch for your laundry, three different types of homemade waxes, a selection of painter pigments and vegetable colorants. You can even get a taste of some Dutch &#39;zwart-wit&#39; powder. Of course, they also sell medicines us &#39;moderns&#39; are familiar with; such as ibuprofen.

### The importance of Woortman

The man to have established the drug store in 1851 was Johan Woortman. The store was quite successful: the name &#39;Woortman&#39; had become a household name in 1889. In fact, it was so successful that the next store owner, Koenraad Plantinga, did not change the name of the store.
The Plantinga family stayed connected to the drug store until 1992. Currently, Hans Rijkman and his assistant Frederike de Boer are in charge of the store (Fig. 2) (Jansen, 2015).

### Questions

Why do you think the Plantinga family eventually lose the store?\
What function do you think the drug store has today?\

### The golden age of self-medication

At the start of the twentieth century, Drogisterij Woortman&#39;s extensively advertised all the ointments, pills and syrups available at their store in Het Utrechtsch Nieuwschblad (The Utrecht Newspaper). This heavy advertising can be tied to what is called the &quot;golden age of self-medication&quot; of the 1900s, wherein a huge number of products were able to flood the Dutch market.
These advertisements could often be seen as a mirror to society, referring to the societal and cultural norms around sickness, healing and health (Huisman, 2002, p. 212-213). An example of this would be Dr. Williams&#39; 1886 Pink Pills for Pale People. It was claimed that these pills could treat almost every disease, such as eczema, paralysis and rickets (Tsay, 2019). Here, the assumption that women should care about &#39;maintaining their beauty&#39; is clearly present in its advertisements (Fig 3).
