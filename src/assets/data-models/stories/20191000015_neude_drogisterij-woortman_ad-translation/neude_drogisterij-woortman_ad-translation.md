### Translation:

**Beware, beautiful women!**\
Beware of the charming but dangerous spring. You are weak, all your organs are weak. Your blood is filled with impurities, and your weak kidneys cannot expel those impurities. They need to be removed from the body. They come out through the skin. Your sweet face will lessen in beauty and will become ugly through rash, red spots, pimples and ulcers. Your intestines are weak, the consequence is blockage that will give you a terrible headache, and that yellow or earthly color that makes you ugly. Your digestion is difficult and painful; after your meals you have an irresistible urge to sleep; your digestion is incomplete and its poisoned remains will in addition poison your already impure blood. Do not purge yourself, the purgation weakens you and you are already weakened.Use a resilient product.The Pink Pills are the most powerful resilient product. They give blood, and you have too little blood. They purify the blood, and the little blood that you have, is impure. They add resilience to your nerves, and your nerves that you have strained through regales, meetings, parties and work, have a great need for new resilience.The Pink Pills will awaken all your organs, which will again do the work that they are supposed to, and the balance will finally be restored. You will be clean again. If you do not take care of yourself now, you will pay for your negligence. Instead of enjoying the beautiful season, you will stay home to suffer, to take care of yourself and be bored.
